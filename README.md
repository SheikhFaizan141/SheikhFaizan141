I like making things, I'm a fairly curious person. 

I am a budding Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for creating dynamic and user-friendly web experiences. My skill set spans both front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Reat, Vue) and back-end frameworks (Laravel, Node.js). I thrive on solving complex problems, optimizing performance, and ensuring seamless functionality across all layers of an application. Additionally, I'm Proficient in Shopify, Iâ€™ve customized themes, created custom sections, and optimized user experiences. My WordPress skills extend to building dynamic websites, managing content, and enhancing SEO. Passionate about creating seamless online solutions, I bring creativity, adaptability, and a customer-centric approach to every project
